                           <p>My husband had lost his parents at an early age, and
           his sister was all the family he had left.</p> 

           <p>So we moved in with my sister-in-law ’s family, to a house in Upper Serangoon. </p>
           <p>They were Peranakan. </p>
           <p>There I learned to help with the family kueh business.</p>

                                   <p>My family grew, and soon, we had to move.</p>
<p>Tampines was our new home, <BR/>
    which we shared with another family.<BR/>
It had an attap roof, and when it rained, <BR/>
we put buckets all over to catch the leaks.<BR/>
Although it was small, it was ours. </p>

<p>But the one window we had, was so narrow <BR/>
That when the lady at the market <BR/>
tried to sell me curtains, I laughed—<BR/>
our window was only one foot wide.</p>
